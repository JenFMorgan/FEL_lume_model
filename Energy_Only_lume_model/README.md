# LUME ML Model Repository

This repository contains a machine learning (ML) model implemented as a [LUME Model](https://github.com/slaclab/lume-model)/. The model the radation energy based on user-defined input parameters (twiss and taper values) and provides examples of its usage, including integration with [Cheetah](https://github.com/desy-ml/cheetah).

## Features
- **LUME Model Integration**: The ML model is saved in the LUME model format for standardization and easy deployment.
- **Example Workflows**: Includes Python scripts demonstrating:
  1. Using the ML model to pedict the energy based on input twiss and taper values.
  2. Integrating the model with [Cheetah](https://github.com/desy-ml/cheetah).
- **Data Visualization**: A histogram of the training data used for the ML model is provided to understand the data distribution.
